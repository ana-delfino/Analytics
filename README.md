# About 

My name is Ana. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro and have a master's degree in Industrial Engineering. I'm an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python, SQL and R programming. I'm studing to be specialized in machine learning techniques and statistical models to merge analytical and business insight skills with advanced data analysis tools for business problem solving.

This is a compilation of projects which I created for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms and statistical models.

## Inequality and violent crime

When I was working at FGV with Bruno Ottoni, we and his studant LÃ©o  Alves, developed a MQ2E model to study the relationship between inequality and violent crime.This paper investigates the relationship between income inequality and violent crimes. To deal with possible endogeneity in income inequality we instrument this variable with coffee productivity. Results show that income inequality is positively associated with crime rates, such as robbery and homicide.

## Comparation between SARIMA, Naive and Holt-Winters' Additive models Additive for forecasting power consumption in the Brazilian electricity market.


This models were developed during my study of Bayesian forecasting in my master's degree. Energy planning is an essential tool to match energy supply and demand. In this context, the estimation of power consumption is an important parameter for policy makers, especially in terms of generation complementation. This study compared the accuracy of consumption forecast in the brazilian energy pool market using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, the Naive model and the  Holt-Winters' Additive model. As a result this work shows that among the analyzed models, the Additive Winters model makes a more accurate forecasting, presenting a MAPE and a smaller RMSE, however the model has problems in representing the statistical characteristics of the historical series.

## Analysis of the generation of energy inflow scenarios for the Northeast and Southeast/ Midwest subsystems, using SARIMA model and Monte Carlo simulation.


This models were developed during my study of Simulation Methods in my master's degree. The Brazilian electricity market is strongly dependent on hydroelectric power and accurate prediction of Affluent Natural Energy (ANE) series is essential for the planning and risk management in Brazilian Electric System (BES). Nowadays, Periodic Autoregressive model is used to generate synthetic series of ANE. Although, there are criticism regarding the performance of the model forecasts, especially in periods of critical affluence. This work uses SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for estimation and the Monte Carlo method for the generation of scenarios to the Northeast and Southeast/Midwest system subsystems, from January to December 2014. As a result, the study show the SARIMA model presents low precision and it cannot be said that the average of the scenarios generated significantly improves the forecast of the models applied.
