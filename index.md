I'm an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python, SQL and R programming. I'm studing to be specialized in machine learning techniques and statistical models to merge analytical and business insight skills with advanced data analysis tools for business problem solving.

This is a compilation of projects which I created for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms and statistical models.



   ### Inequality and violent crime

When I was working at FGV with Bruno Ottoni, we and his studant LÃ©o  Alves, developed a MQ2E model to study the relationship between inequality and violent crime.This paper investigates the relationship between income inequality and violent crimes. To deal with possible endogeneity in income inequality we instrument this variable with coffee productivity. Results show that income inequality is positively associated with crime rates, such as robbery and homicide.
