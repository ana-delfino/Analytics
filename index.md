## Welcome to my GitHub 

My name is Ana.I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Economist from Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro and 

This it´s a compilation of projects which I created for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms and statiscal models. 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ana-delfino/anadelfino.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ana-delfino/anadelfino.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
